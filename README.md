# hilmi's Small Projects
Repository for some small projects that I've done when my hands kinda itching to type and write something.. also good for some refresher of what I've learned so far so why not.

..or sometimes just project for the lulz. :P

## Finished projects

1. [Coin Flip Simulation (java)](https://github.com/hilmihisham/Small-Projects/blob/master/CoinFlipSimulation/CoinFlip.java)
   - Simulates flipping a coin n-times and print every results and head/tail count
   - Finished 05 August 2018
   
2. [Find Sum from List (java)](https://github.com/hilmihisham/Small-Projects/tree/master/FindSumFromList)
   - From a number list (int array), find x + y that equals to a given number z
     - Sort the list
     - Set pointers to both ends
     - If the sum of both numbers on the pointers < z, move front pointer up
     - If the sum > z, move back pointer down
     - When both pointer overlaps, then there's no x and y that summed up to z
   - Finished 13 August 2018
